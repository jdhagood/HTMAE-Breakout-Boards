# Breakout Boards for HTMAE 2024 
This repo includes the gerber files for some breakout boards used to breadboard protoype the microcontrollers used in HTMAE. I will update it as I make more. Hope this helps some people out. :) 

All PCB should be able to be milled out with a 1/32" PCB Conservative end mill and 1/64 PCB conserative end mill 

__Warning:__ The SAMD11 board currently has spots that are not manufacturable. Working on fixes
