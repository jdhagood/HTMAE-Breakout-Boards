# Breakout Boards for HTMAE 2024
This repo includes the gerber files for some breakout boards used to breadboard prototype the microcontrollers used in HTMAE. I will update it as I make more. Hope this helps some people out. :) 

All PCB should be able to be milled out with a 1/32" PCB Conservative end mill and 1/64 PCB conservative end mill.
